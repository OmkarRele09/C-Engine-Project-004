# ⚙️ C-Engine-004 — Car Mileage Calculator 🚗⛽

Part of my **C-Engine Series**, where I merge mechanical concepts with C programming to build mini-engineering tools.

here is the project link :- https://github.com/OmkarRele09/C-Engine-Project-004/blob/main/carmileagecalculator.c

## 🔥 About
This program calculates a vehicle's mileage (km/l) using basic inputs from the user.  
Inspired by real fuel monitoring systems used in automobiles.

## 📐 Formula Used
- Mileage (km/l) = Distance / Fuel  

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Variables (`float`)  
- User input using `scanf()`  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Clean and structured C code  

## 📁 Repository Info
- Series: `C-Engine`  
- Project No: `004`  
- Author: **Omkar Rele**  
- Language: C
